Track bugs in a separate disconnected history in the same git
repository that houses your code.

The bugs themselves can be elsewhere, such as Trac, the first step is
tracking what commit fixes what.

Tree layout::

     <bug_id>/found/<sha-1>
     <bug_id>/notfound/<sha-1>

Zero length files.

Check out debbugs version tracking.
